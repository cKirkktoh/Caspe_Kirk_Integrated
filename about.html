        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Kirk Caspe, who really loves taking photos<br>
            especially nature. You can discover beauty in the world <br>
            through photography. Finding beauty in the<br> 
            things and people around us by using a camera helps<br>
            us to view things differently.<br>
            <br>
            I was born at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and grew and lived there for 17 years<br>
            before moving back to the Philippines to study at my last senior high school<br>
            year. Before finishing my final high school year, at December 8th, we flew to<br>
            Canada. My parents sacrificed their jobs at Saudi just to give me and my little<br>
            brother to have a bright future ahead of us.

            Not only I am into photography but I am really a sports person.<br>
            Especially basketball and football but some would call it, "Soccer".<br>
            <br>
            Well not only sports is my interest but travelling is my number one hobby.<br>
            Ever since me and my family first travelled to Hong Kong for vacation when I<br>
            was a kid, I already knew at that point that travelling would make escape<br>
            reality. And year after year, after finishing each of our school years, we travelled<br>
            to so many places. Here are some of the countries I've visited in order.<br>
            <ul>
            <li> Hong Kong (2012) </li>
            <li> Singapore (2013) </li>
            <li> UAE (2014) </li>
            <li> South Korea (2015) </li>
            <li> Japan (2018) </li>
            <li> Spain (2018) </li>
            <li> Italy (2018) </li>
            <li> Switzerland (2018) </li>
            <li> Belgium (2018) </li>
            <li> Netherlands (2018) </li>
            <li> France (2018) </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Ever since I put my foot at the heart of Tokyo, I pulled out my phone just to<br>
            take photos and I, was amazed by my shot. That is the day, I became interested in<br>
            photography. Taking photos of the breathtaking nature of this world, the beautiful<br>
            skyscrapers of the city, and the captivating landmarks of each place is my favorite<br>
            thing to do.</p>
